# Public Transport Analysis Tools

---

### This repository contains:

- CSV to JSON functions for public transport traffic files
- OSMNX & FOLIUM area coverage functions
- Public transport graph builder functions
- CSVs & JSONs with public transport stops and routes of Lviv (relevance: May, 2022)

---

### Motivation:

This project was created to develop tools to find flaws in Lviv's public transport system and create recommendations on station placements and route changes. Using these tools we proposed 5 new public transport stops to Lviv City Council.

---

### Usability:

Functions can be applied to analyse any city's public transport, given the data in proper formats (look in "Data Description" section)
